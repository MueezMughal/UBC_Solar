# Hi, Iâ€™m Mueez

Iâ€™m a **Mechanical Engineering student at the University of British Columbia**, specializing in **Mechatronics**. My work sits at the intersection of **mechanical design**, **embedded systems**, and **data-driven problem solving**, areas where I can bring together creativity, precision, and practical engineering.

I currently work as a **Mechanical Engineering Intern at Suncor Energy**, where I design and implement Python-based physics models to improve the reliability of Electric Submersible Pumps (ESPs) used in SAGD operations. By modeling well dynamics and solids behavior, Iâ€™ve helped identify early signs of production inefficiencies, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing costly downtime. One of my most impactful contributions was developing an algorithm to detect snapped ESP shafts without performing boiler feedwater flushes, saving both production time and operational resources.

At **UBC Solar**, I lead the **Vehicle Dynamics team**, contributing to the design of our fourth-generation solar car. My focus areas include **suspension design, structural analysis, and ergonomic integration**. I designed and validated the lower control arms and steering wheel assembly using **SolidWorks** and **ANSYS**, achieving significant weight reductions while maintaining stiffness and safety under race conditions. I also conducted a mini research study on **pull-rod rocker suspension geometry**, modeling the system as a 2DOF dynamic model and applying Fourier analysis to understand ride dynamics and compliance.

Iâ€™m passionate about turning complex engineering theory into **functional, real-world systems**, from control algorithms and embedded code to high-precision CAD and FEA simulations. I enjoy working across disciplines, connecting hardware and software to create systems that are efficient, manufacturable, and robust.

Outside of engineering, I spend most of my time **hiking and skiing** across Alberta and British Columbia. Whether itâ€™s designing a part or navigating a trail, Iâ€™m drawn to challenges that push me to think critically, adapt quickly, and create something meaningful from the process.

### ðŸŒ² Outside the Lab
When Iâ€™m not designing or coding, youâ€™ll usually find me **hiking, skiing, or exploring trails around AB & BC**. I love working on projects that blend technical creativity with hands-on experience, whether thatâ€™s in the machine shop, on a mountain, or in the middle of a debugging session.
