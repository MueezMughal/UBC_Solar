# Suncor ‚Äì Real-Time Production Visualization (Firebag SAGD Site)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This project involved confidential facility and production data from Suncor‚Äôs Firebag SAGD site. All process values and identifiers have been redacted for privacy.

## Overview
This project showcases the development of a **comprehensive PI Vision dashboard system** that visualizes the **flow of gas and emulsion from subsurface wells to the central processing plant**.  
The system was designed to help engineers quickly locate production bottlenecks, streamline communication between field and exploitation teams, and enhance overall operational efficiency across Firebag‚Äôs SAGD operations.

## Objectives
- Build an **intuitive, plant-wide visualization** for emulsion and gas tracking  
- Map **mass flow relationships** between wells, separators, and process units using **P&IDs and fluid mass balance**  
- Enable **real-time anomaly detection** and rapid bottleneck resolution  
- Create a **reusable framework** for future dashboard expansions and cross-team standardization  

## Key Work
- Designed and implemented multiple **PI Vision dashboards** for emulsion, gas, and test well data streams  
- Parsed and interpreted **hundreds of P&IDs** to construct an accurate digital twin of the subsurface-to-plant flow network  
- Developed interactive visual elements including **KPIs, flow indicators, and node-based navigation**  
- Incorporated **mass balance calculations** to verify data accuracy and detect inconsistencies in real time  
- Collaborated with both **Field and Exploitation engineers** to align technical functionality with user needs and plant workflows  
- Conducted a **case study** following a lightning strike event, using the dashboard to locate **50 m¬≥/hr of missing emulsion (~\$18,000/hr)** in under five minutes  
- Presented the final system and workflow results to a **cross-disciplinary audience of ~100 engineers**, receiving adoption recommendations for future pad and plant integrations
